# Unittests and Integration Tests

Unit testing involves the evaluation of whether a specific function produces anticipated outcomes for a variety of input sets. These tests encompass both standard inputs and exceptional scenarios. The scope of a unit test is confined to examining the internal logic of the targeted function. To achieve this, numerous calls to auxiliary functions should be substituted with mock versions, particularly if these functions trigger network or database interactions.

The primary objective of a unit test is to address the following query: If all external components function as intended, does this particular function also operate as intended?

In contrast, integration tests are designed to evaluate an entire code pathway from start to finish. Typically, only fundamental functions that initiate external operations such as HTTP requests, file input/output, and database operations are replicated by mock implementations.

Integration tests aim to scrutinize the interactions among all sections of your code, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of the system's functionality.
